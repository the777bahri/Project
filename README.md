Reinforcement Learning Project
This project uses Python, PyBullet, and Stable-Baselines3 for training an agent to learn various tasks. The following instructions will guide you through setting up your development environment.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.10 (Anaconda recommended)
Visual Studio Code or any other IDE
An internet connection to install dependencies
Setting Up the Environment
Install Anaconda:
If you don't already have Anaconda installed, download and install it from here.

Create a New Conda Environment:

Open Anaconda Prompt and create a new environment:

bash
Copy code
conda create -n rl_env python=3.10
Activate the environment:

bash
Copy code
conda activate rl_env
Installing Dependencies
Upgrade Pip and Setuptools:

Ensure that pip and setuptools are up-to-date:

bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
Install PyTorch:

Install the CPU version of PyTorch (since you don't have a GPU):

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
Install Stable-Baselines3:

Install Stable-Baselines3, which requires PyTorch:

bash
Copy code
pip install stable-baselines3
Install Additional Dependencies:

If your project requires additional libraries like PyBullet, install them:

bash
Copy code
pip install pybullet numpy
Usage
After setting up your environment and installing the necessary dependencies, you can run your Python scripts in your environment.

To start training the agent:

bash
Copy code
python your_script.py
Replace your_script.py with the name of your Python file.

Stopping and Saving the Model
To manually stop and save the model during training:

Press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the training process.
Ensure that your script handles saving the model when interrupted, for example:
python
Copy code
model.save("path_to_save_model/model_name")
You can later load the model for continued training:

python
Copy code
model = PPO.load("path_to_save_model/model_name")
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
ModuleNotFoundError: Ensure all dependencies are installed in your activated environment.
Dependency Conflicts: Try creating a new virtual environment and installing the dependencies from scratch.
